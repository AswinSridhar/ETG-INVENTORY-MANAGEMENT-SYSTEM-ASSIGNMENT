         1)INVENTORY.JSON - It shows the total inventory.
                            The inventory consists of 30 products.
                            Each product has five attributes - ProductName

                                            In code we used 4 choices -- 1)Adding a product to inventory(For clarification,I added Two products Which is shown in the code)-In                                                                                adding process we will add a new product with all the attributes we need to display in inventory.
                                                                         2)Removing a Product To inventory- In this step we will remove a total product from the inventory.
                                                                         3)Showing the items
